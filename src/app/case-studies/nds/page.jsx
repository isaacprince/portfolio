          Making the design system that works.

        <p className="text-[1.5rem] font-normal text-black">
          A design system is a set of standards, guidelines, and tools that help
          teams design and build digital products more efficiently and
          consistently. It serves as a single source of truth for the visual and
          interactive elements of a product, including typography, color,
          layout, and functionality.

        <br />
        <p className="text-[1.5rem] font-normal text-black">
          One of the main benefits of a design system is that it promotes
          consistency across a product or brand. By establishing a set of rules
          for design and development, a design system helps ensure that all
          parts of a product feel connected and cohesive, rather than Making
          sure the button group is consistent with the rest of the design system
          Make sure the button group is consistent with the rest of the design
          system, like a collection of unrelated features. This can be
          especially important for large organizations that have multiple teams
          working on different parts of the product.

        <br />
        <p className="text-[1.5rem] font-normal text-black">
          A design system can also help teams work more efficiently by providing
          a set of pre-designed and tested components that can be quickly and
          easily incorporated into new designs. This can save time and reduce
          the need for teams to start from scratch every time they work on a new
          feature or redesign an existing one.

          The federal government of Nigeria operates numerous websites and
          digital applications, each with its own design language and user
          experience. This lack of consistency can be confusing and frustrating
          for citizens trying to access government services online. Furthermore,
          the lack of a centralized design system results in inefficient
          resource utilization because designers must recreate common UI
          elements and patterns for each new project.

            To address this problem, we propose the development of a design
            system that will provide a shared set of visual design principles
            and styles, as well as a library of reusable UI components and
            patterns, for use across all federal government digital products.
            This will improve the user experience for citizens as well as
            increase efficiency in the design and development process for
            government teams.
